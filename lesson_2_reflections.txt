What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it makes a project folder that allows you to hold your files and metadata about the changes that occur during the life of the project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds files to be committed to the repository and acts as a focusing and organizing layer between the repository and working directory. The goal is to make small commits rather than committing all the project files every time. It's also valuable for organizing your thinking and making one commit per logical change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Using git diff with the staging area will allow you to check any changes between the working directory and staging area. While git diff --staged will allow you to see the differences between the repositories most recent commit and the staged change, which allows you to ensure exactly what one logical change you are committing before doing so.
